The image creates a strong perspective illusion. Emphasize the 3D effect of the girl standing out from the phone. She wears black-rimmed glasses, high-street fashion, and strikes a cute, playful pose. The phone screen is treated as a dark floor, like a small stage. The scene uses strong forced perspective to show the proportional difference between the hand, the phone, and the girl. The background is clean gray, using soft indoor light, shallow depth of field, and the overall style is surrealistic photorealistic compositing. Very strong perspective.

A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture. Subtle light rays stream down diagonally from the top. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography has a faint glow. All elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card. Use {{logo: "Tesla logo"}}, {{ticker: "TSLA"}}, {{company_name: "Tesla Inc."}}, {{card_number: "#0006"}}, {{revenue: "$96.8B"}}, {{year: "2025"}}, {{colors: ["red", "white"]}}.
